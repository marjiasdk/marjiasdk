## About Me:
Hi! My name is Marjia Siddik and I am a First Year Computer Science Student at Dublin City University.
<br></br>
I'm currently working on two projects: a Python banking application with a user interface and a chatbot with a user interface that uses NLP technology to generate responses. These projects have allowed me to hone my programming skills and explore new technologies, while also gaining valuable experience in software development.
<br></br>
In addition to my ongoing projects, I recently completed a personal portfolio website that showcases my work and skills as a developer. It's currently hosted on Github pages and I'm excited to continue expanding it in the future.
