## About Me:
Hi! My name is Marjia Siddik and I am a first-year computer science student at Dublin City University.<br>

I have a strong foundation in web development and have completed a personal portfolio website that showcases my skills in this area. Currently, I'm focused on three projects: a banking app with a user-friendly interface, a chatbot that uses natural language processing to generate responses, and a poetry website that promotes my upcoming book. These projects are helping me develop my skills in Python, web development, and user interface design.<br>

If you're interested in collaborating or learning more about my skills and projects, please feel free to reach out. I'm always open to new ideas and opportunities!<br>
