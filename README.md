## <i>about me:</i>
Hi! My name is Marjia Siddik, and I am a Computer Science Student at Dublin City University. <br>

I have a solid foundation in web development and have completed a personal portfolio website that showcases my skills in this area. I have also completed a simple banking application in Python in order to improve my programming skills. Currently, I'm focused on creating a chatbot with a Tkinter GUI. These projects are helping me develop my skills in Python, web development, and user interface design.<br>

If you're interested in collaborating or learning more about my skills and projects, please feel free to reach out. I'm always open to new ideas and opportunities!<br>
